# 🍷 Wine Quality Predictor Flask Application

This is a Flask web application that predicts the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. The application uses a machine learning regression model trained on a dataset of red wine characteristics.

## ✨ Features

* **User-friendly Interface:** Simple web form for entering wine properties.
* **Regression Model:** Predicts a continuous wine quality score (e.g., from 3 to 8).
* **Auto-fill Buttons:** Quick testing with predefined values for low, medium, and high-quality wines.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
* **Landing Page:** An attractive introduction page for the application.

## 🚀 How It Works

The application uses a `RandomForestRegressor` model, which was trained on the [Wine Quality Red dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). Input features are scaled using `StandardScaler` before prediction to ensure consistent results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language
* **Flask:** Web framework
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model (RandomForestRegressor, StandardScaler)
* **NumPy, Pandas:** For data handling
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For the front-end interface

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the code):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AliGohar2151/Wine-Quality-Predictor.git](https://github.com/AliGohar2151/Wine-Quality-Predictor.git) # Use your actual repo URL
    cd Wine-Quality-Predictor
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Download the Dataset:**
    * Download `winequality-red.csv` from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). Ensure it's named `winequality-red (1).csv` (or adjust `train_model.py` if the name differs) and place it in the project's root directory.

6.  **Generate Machine Learning Model Files:**
    Run the training script to generate the `wine_model_regression.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` files.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    *(Note: These `.pkl` files are intentionally excluded from Git. They will be generated locally when you run this script.)*

7.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

8.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
